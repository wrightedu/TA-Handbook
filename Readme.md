## Getting Started
So you've been hired as a CS/CEG Teaching Assistants (TA). Congratuations ðŸ¥³.
You can treat this repository as general guide to being a TA. You'll meet a lot 
of many great people and students in the department. It's a great networking and learning opportunity

## Clocking Hours
1. To clock hours, first go to ![Wings Express](https://wingsexpress.wright.edu/)
You should have a new employee tab here.

2. From here, select the timesheet tab.
If you have multiple positions at the university, here is where you can select 
which timesheet to bill your hours for which job. This includes work-study positions. If 
this is your only position (and you haven't changed to/from a work study) you will likely only
have a single selection

3. Hours can be clocked in this screen in 2-week chunks. It is recommended to fill 
this out as you work. At the end of the 2-week period, you'll receive an email from payroll saying that
timesheets are due sometime soon. This is your cue to go to this page and hit the `Submit for Approval` button.
After a few days, your timesheet approver will (hopefully) approve your hours and will be payed the following Thursday
*DO NOT CLOCK MORE THAN 28 HOURS PER WEEK* (56 per pay period) If you do so, your employment will be terminated, and you will have to be
rehired to fix it. 

## What can be clocked:
Any job related work may clocked in your timesheet. This includes, but is defintely not limited to:
- Meetings
- Grading
- Labs
- Office Hours
- Answering a bunch of angry student emails
- Writing guides in a repository for future TAs
Just make sure you don't work for free and that your timesheet accuretely reflects the hours you worked. Having some tractability here
is helpful, but not strictly necessary.

## Forgetting to Submit your Timesheet
We have all done this before. You got the timesheet email, but it just slips away sometimes.
The first thing to do is to go the payroll department in 204 University Hall. They'll get you a paper timesheet to fill out instead. 
Check out [this guide](resources/Blank-Time-Sheet-with-Instructions-and-Example-New.pdf) for more detailed instructions on filling these out.
You will need a physical signature from your usual timesheet approver.
If you are able to get your paper timesheet approved before the standard deadline (usually the following Monday at noon) you'll
still be paid at the usual time. If not, it will go onto your paycheck

## Working well with students

Working well with students is probably what you'll be doing most often as a TA. You were hired because somebody was
confident that you were one of the best people for this job. The difficult part comes from clearly communicating that 
to students. A good TA is clear and approachable, while also being empathetic.  

- Clarity: To be as clear as you can be when conveying a concept to a student, you will likely need multiple ways of explaing
it. Having a handful of different, but linked ideas of a concept is something that comes with time, but will greatly benefit
students unstanding of your explanation. 

- Approachability: Students tend to get the most of labs if they are not afraid to ask the TA a "stupid" question. Being casual and approachable
really helps students feel comfortable and facilitates a better learning environment

- Empathy: Stuff happens. Life is chaotic and people's lives are unpredictable. You should account for this in all things and if
students ask for a deadline extension for a valid reason, make reasonable accomadations. Balancing empathy and being fair to everyone can be challenging.
